        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl
        species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the

        ><sup>[1]</sup> that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or
        cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called
        a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female
        bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
        were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries
        BC).<sup>[2][3]</sup> Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of
        food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird)
          originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid
          the sexual connotation of the original English cock,[24][25][26] and
          is widely used throughout North America. Roosting is the action of
          perching aloft to sleep at night.[27]

      <h3>Behavior</h3>
      <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
      <p>
        Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a
        communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young.
        Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a
        'pecking order', with dominant individuals having priority for food
        access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock
        causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking
        order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an
        existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[34]
      </p>
      <h4>Vocalizations</h4>
      <p>
        When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He
        does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping
        the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call
        their chicks and encourage them to eat. A rooster's crowing is a loud
        and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other
        roosters.[35] However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden
        disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying
        an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different
        warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on
        the ground.[36]
